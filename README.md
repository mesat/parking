# Parking Application


A parking application that manages automatically a parking facility.


We have a parking lot that can be parked up to 10 slots (you can consider each slot is 1 unit range) at any given point in time. 

Created an automated ticketing system that allows customers to use the parking lot without human intervention. 

When a vehicle enters the lot, the application give a unique ticket issued to the driver. 

The ticket issuing process includes us documenting the plate and the colour of the car and allocating an available slots to the car before actually handing over a ticket to the driver. 

When a vehicle holds number of slots with its own width, the application leaves 1 unit slot to next one. 

The customer should be allocated slot(s) which is nearest to the entry. 

At the exit the customer returns the ticket which then marks slot(s) they were using as being available. 

The Project was created using Spring Boot.
